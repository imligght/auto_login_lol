# Automation for the LOL login

## Automatic login in League of Legends

### How does it work

I made this program to automate the login process in the game League of Legends.

To install and use this script, just clone this repository in your PC

```
git clone https://github.com/imligght/auto_login_lol.git
```

and, inside of the src folder, run the main.py file.

You will then, type 'new' to create a new account,
give an arbitrary name for your new account (you will use this name to select the account you want to log in)
and finally, type your login credentials to be stored in memory.
WARNING: I will in no way have access to the data entered here, it will only be saved on your computer.
